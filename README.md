# Hackathon
# Maze Challenge

This project is an engaging game crafted with `pygame`, featuring randomly generated mazes based on the DFS algorithm. The player's mission is to navigate through the maze and reach the end point using fewer steps than the AI, which employs the A* algorithm.

## Gameplay

In this game, players will navigate through increasingly challenging mazes, controlling a character via keyboard. Each maze is designed to be more challenging than the last. The game enters a new level with a freshly generated maze each time the player reaches the end point, aiming to find a shorter path than the one used by the AI.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed:

- Python 
- Pygame 

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install Pygame if you haven't already

## Running the Game

Follow these steps to get the game running on your computer:

1. First, initiate the bot script by running: python3 bot.py 
2. After the bot is up and running, start the main program: python main.py



Upon launching the game, you control your character using the keyboard. The objective is to move from the top-left corner of the maze to the lower-right corner as the end point.

## Usage

Once the game starts, you'll be controlling a character on the screen using your keyboard's arrow keys. Your task is to find a path to the green square representing the end point. This path should be shorter than the one proposed by the AI using the A* algorithm.
